      把最近一次的静态冲突结论落盘，好让崩溃监视器（跑在另一线程、常常是下一次会话）仍能判断这次崩溃背后有没有已知冲突 —— 并保证结论绑定在“当时那批 staged Mod”上。
      
  en: >
      Persist the last static-conflict verdict so the crash watcher (running on another thread, often in a later session) can still tell whether this crash had a known conflict behind it — and keep the answer tied to the exact staged mod set it was computed for.

          Read that verdict back (empty when it was never written or has gone stale).

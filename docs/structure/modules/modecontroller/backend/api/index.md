      前端进入后端的唯一门：一个类上挂几十个 js_api 方法 —— Mod 库读写与导入、依赖清单与安装进度、一键启动与启动预览、设置与主题、自检与修复、崩溃包与诊断包、公告与预警。构造必须快，重活丢后台线程 + 进度轮询。

      The only door the UI has into the backend: one class carrying dozens of js_api methods — mod-library read/import, dependency manifest and install progress, one-click launch and preview, settings and theme, self-check and repair, crash/diagnostic bundles, announcements and alerts. Construction must stay fast; heavy work goes to background threads with progress polling.
